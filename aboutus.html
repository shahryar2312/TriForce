            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>We are the founders of Ambroise. We are all Computer Science graduates from Griffith College, Cork. As we did not get any IT jobs, we decided to open a restaurant which is a mix of French, Mexican, Italian, and South Asian food. Our coordination with each other made this dream possible.</p>

                <p>Hello, I am Isaac. I am from Mexico. Since I was a child, I knew I had a passion for cooking. I am a chef specializing in Mexican, French, and Italian cuisine. I love taking the simplest recipe and elevating it to its highest level while keeping it simple and preserving its true flavor.</p>

My passion for food and my desire to have a restaurant where I can make people happy with the wonders of Italian and French cuisine, combined with the new flavors of Mexican food, inspired me to innovate and open "Ambroise," a place where food reaches another level.</p>
